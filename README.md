Yes, another method involves using a subquery to get the maximum createDateTime for each redemptionDate and then joining it back to the main table. This would ensure that only the most recent record for each date is fetched.

Hereâ€™s the high-level approach:

Use a subquery to fetch the maximum createDateTime for each redemptionDate for the specified retailer and date range.
Join the result of this subquery with the tblRedemptions-ByDay table to retrieve the corresponding redemptionCount.
